Project for creating a custom Source 2 SDK
## Installing or Cloning

run tools.bat for tools

## **Important!**

**The Weapons will have no material, that is because I couldnt upload the shader called vr_complex because github has a limit of 100 mb and that shader has a file over 100, you can make your own shaders_pc pak with that included,using the vpk.exe from csgo/bin folder, just make a folder called shaders_pc_dir and run command `vpk -M -c 20 shaders_pc_dir` inside the bin folder and copy all the paks to game/base (also delete existing ones). Weapons will work now.**
